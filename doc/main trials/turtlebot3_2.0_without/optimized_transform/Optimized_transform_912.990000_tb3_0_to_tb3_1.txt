Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-136.903, 35.8035, -0.0468626)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-137.783, 31.6674, -0.0551499)

Error of original is 16.1041 pixels translation and 0.0468626 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 11.8761 pixels translation and 0.0551499 radians rotation
