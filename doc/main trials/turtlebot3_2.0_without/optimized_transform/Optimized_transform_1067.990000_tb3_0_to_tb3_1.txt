Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-138.945, 45.1049, -0.00639061)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-142.885, 39.2564, -0.0159466)

Error of original is 25.1271 pixels translation and 0.00639061 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 19.4712 pixels translation and 0.0159466 radians rotation
