Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-124.054, 13.815, 0.217675)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-138.011, 23.77, -0.0874361)

Error of original is 17.1034 pixels translation and 0.217675 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 4.26269 pixels translation and 0.0874361 radians rotation
