Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-81.1996, 33.5099, 0.231319)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-81.1996, 33.5099, 0.231319)

Error of original is 60.3324 pixels translation and 0.231319 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 60.3324 pixels translation and 0.231319 radians rotation
