Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-120.998, 65.2955, 0.299784)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-120.96, 64.0069, 0.296341)

Error of original is 49.1199 pixels translation and 0.299784 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 47.9494 pixels translation and 0.296341 radians rotation
