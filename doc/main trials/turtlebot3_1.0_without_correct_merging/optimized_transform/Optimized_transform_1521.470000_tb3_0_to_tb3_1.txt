Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-91.2714, 34.5406, 0.231322)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-91.2714, 34.5406, 0.231322)

Error of original is 50.8518 pixels translation and 0.231322 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 50.8518 pixels translation and 0.231322 radians rotation
