Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-82.58, 33.3696, 0.228377)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-82.7921, 33.5104, 0.228998)

Error of original is 58.9559 pixels translation and 0.228377 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 58.7815 pixels translation and 0.228998 radians rotation
