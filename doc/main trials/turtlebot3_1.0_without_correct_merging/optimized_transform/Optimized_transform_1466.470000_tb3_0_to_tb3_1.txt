Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-90.4885, 35.1283, 0.231694)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-90.6568, 35.3106, 0.232339)

Error of original is 51.7712 pixels translation and 0.231694 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 51.6639 pixels translation and 0.232339 radians rotation
