Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-112.137, 31.964, 0.212627)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-112.231, 32.2206, 0.211047)

Error of original is 30.3226 pixels translation and 0.212627 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 30.3387 pixels translation and 0.211047 radians rotation
