Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-86.7809, 35.0614, 0.251003)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-87.0844, 35.6709, 0.252826)

Error of original is 55.3093 pixels translation and 0.251003 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 55.1872 pixels translation and 0.252826 radians rotation
