Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-133.119, 68.2295, 0.320068)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-133.126, 68.2294, 0.320073)

Error of original is 48.718 pixels translation and 0.320068 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 48.7168 pixels translation and 0.320073 radians rotation
