Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-127.503, 31.9181, 0.125113)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-127.788, 29.0744, 0.120855)

Error of original is 17.2686 pixels translation and 0.125113 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 15.2145 pixels translation and 0.120855 radians rotation
