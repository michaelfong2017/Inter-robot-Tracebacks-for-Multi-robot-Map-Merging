Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-129.486, 26.5867, 0.136325)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-129.54, 26.6775, 0.13514)

Error of original is 12.4065 pixels translation and 0.136325 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 12.4098 pixels translation and 0.13514 radians rotation
