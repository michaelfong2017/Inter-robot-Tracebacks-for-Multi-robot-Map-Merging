Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-129.235, 26.8594, 0.125108)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-129.188, 26.6063, 0.125148)

Error of original is 12.7645 pixels translation and 0.125108 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 12.6706 pixels translation and 0.125148 radians rotation
