Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-127.732, 28.6315, 0.134946)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-127.732, 28.6315, 0.134946)

Error of original is 15.0004 pixels translation and 0.134946 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 15.0004 pixels translation and 0.134946 radians rotation
