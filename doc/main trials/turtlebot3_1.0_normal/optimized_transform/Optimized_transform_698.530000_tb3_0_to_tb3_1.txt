Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-128.496, 29.3771, 0.121267)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-128.501, 29.3802, 0.121213)

Error of original is 14.8413 pixels translation and 0.121267 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 14.8399 pixels translation and 0.121213 radians rotation
