Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-104.467, 40.587, 0.334307)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-104.467, 40.587, 0.334307)

Error of original is 41.066 pixels translation and 0.334307 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 41.066 pixels translation and 0.334307 radians rotation
