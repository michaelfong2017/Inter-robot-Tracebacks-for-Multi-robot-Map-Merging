Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-129.664, 26.8424, 0.132304)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-129.664, 26.8424, 0.132304)

Error of original is 12.3954 pixels translation and 0.132304 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 12.3954 pixels translation and 0.132304 radians rotation
