Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-129.063, 26.5015, 0.125406)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-129.029, 26.3256, 0.125641)

Error of original is 12.7235 pixels translation and 0.125406 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 12.6641 pixels translation and 0.125641 radians rotation
