Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-127.938, 29.0266, 0.1316)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-127.922, 28.8849, 0.13169)

Error of original is 15.0653 pixels translation and 0.1316 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 14.994 pixels translation and 0.13169 radians rotation
