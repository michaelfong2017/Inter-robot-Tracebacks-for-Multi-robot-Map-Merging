Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-129.479, 26.7486, 0.135911)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-129.42, 26.4572, 0.137513)

Error of original is 12.4998 pixels translation and 0.135911 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 12.3949 pixels translation and 0.137513 radians rotation
