Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-126.847, 33.4044, 0.138196)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-127.553, 32.1512, 0.128734)

Error of original is 18.7797 pixels translation and 0.138196 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 17.3945 pixels translation and 0.128734 radians rotation
