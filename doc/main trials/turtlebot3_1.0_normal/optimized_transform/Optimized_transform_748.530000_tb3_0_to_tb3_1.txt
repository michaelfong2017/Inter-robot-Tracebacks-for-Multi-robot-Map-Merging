Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-128.63, 29.8294, 0.123371)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-128.543, 30.6877, 0.125111)

Error of original is 15.0302 pixels translation and 0.123371 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 15.6682 pixels translation and 0.125111 radians rotation
