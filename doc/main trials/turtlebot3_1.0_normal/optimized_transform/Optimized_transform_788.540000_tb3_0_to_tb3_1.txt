Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-128.509, 30.3539, 0.124105)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-128.524, 30.4465, 0.123368)

Error of original is 15.4678 pixels translation and 0.124105 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 15.5185 pixels translation and 0.123368 radians rotation
