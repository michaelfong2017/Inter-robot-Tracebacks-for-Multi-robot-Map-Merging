Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-123.69, 62.0514, 0.118429)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-124.034, 62.5841, 0.116558)

Error of original is 45.1038 pixels translation and 0.118429 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 45.4788 pixels translation and 0.116558 radians rotation
