Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-128.46, 23.9323, 0.120859)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-128.442, 23.8447, 0.120941)

Error of original is 12.1917 pixels translation and 0.120859 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 12.1806 pixels translation and 0.120941 radians rotation
