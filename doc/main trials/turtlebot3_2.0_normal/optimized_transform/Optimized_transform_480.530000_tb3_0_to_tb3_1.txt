Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-133.915, 21.2383, 0.00462708)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-133.536, 23.2813, 0.00592766)

Error of original is 6.21015 pixels translation and 0.00462708 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 7.24918 pixels translation and 0.00592766 radians rotation
