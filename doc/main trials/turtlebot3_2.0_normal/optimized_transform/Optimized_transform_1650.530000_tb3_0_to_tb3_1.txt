Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-137.498, 9.53188, -0.0624576)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-136.941, 9.63969, -0.0634538)

Error of original is 10.7629 pixels translation and 0.0624576 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 10.8024 pixels translation and 0.0634538 radians rotation
