Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_2's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-10, -60, -0.785)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (0.0960337, -48.569, -0.763036)

Error of adjusted is 15.2511 pixels translation and 0.021964 radians rotation
