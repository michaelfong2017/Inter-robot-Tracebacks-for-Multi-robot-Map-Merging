Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-164.245, 70.2127, 0.00433567)

Error of adjusted is 55.7596 pixels translation and 0.00433567 radians rotation
