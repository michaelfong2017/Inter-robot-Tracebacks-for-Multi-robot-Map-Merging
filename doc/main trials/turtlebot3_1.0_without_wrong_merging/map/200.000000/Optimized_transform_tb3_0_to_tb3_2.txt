Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_2's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-10, -60, -0.785)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-9.61348, -64.8275, -0.808781)

Error of adjusted is 4.84296 pixels translation and 0.023781 radians rotation
