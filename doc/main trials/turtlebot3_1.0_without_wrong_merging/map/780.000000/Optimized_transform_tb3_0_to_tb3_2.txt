Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_2's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-10, -60, -0.785)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-0.821087, -51.5267, -0.781347)

Error of adjusted is 12.492 pixels translation and 0.00365322 radians rotation
