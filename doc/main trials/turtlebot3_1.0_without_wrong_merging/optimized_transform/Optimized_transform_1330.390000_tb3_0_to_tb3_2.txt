Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_2's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-10, -60, -0.785)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-8.35536, -101.98, -0.768592)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-7.61797, -103.032, -0.767988)

Error of original is 42.0123 pixels translation and 0.0164077 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 43.0974 pixels translation and 0.017012 radians rotation
