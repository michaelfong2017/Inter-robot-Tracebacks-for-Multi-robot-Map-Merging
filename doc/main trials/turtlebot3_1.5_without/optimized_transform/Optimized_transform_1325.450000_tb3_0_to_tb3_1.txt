Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-105.019, 16.6555, 0.123376)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-105.019, 16.6555, 0.123376)

Error of original is 35.1407 pixels translation and 0.123376 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 35.1407 pixels translation and 0.123376 radians rotation
