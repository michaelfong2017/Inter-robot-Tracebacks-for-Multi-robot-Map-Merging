Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-105.317, 16.08, 0.123382)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-105.246, 16.5085, 0.124274)

Error of original is 34.9042 pixels translation and 0.123382 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 34.9292 pixels translation and 0.124274 radians rotation
