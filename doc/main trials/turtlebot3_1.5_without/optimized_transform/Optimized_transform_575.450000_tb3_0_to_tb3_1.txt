Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-102.067, 16.798, 0.0967067)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-101.443, 17.8266, 0.0957719)

Error of original is 38.0682 pixels translation and 0.0967067 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 38.6181 pixels translation and 0.0957719 radians rotation
