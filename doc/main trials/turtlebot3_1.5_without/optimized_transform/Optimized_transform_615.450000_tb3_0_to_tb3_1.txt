Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-101.739, 17.4137, 0.0986843)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-101.489, 17.4845, 0.0989752)

Error of original is 38.3482 pixels translation and 0.0986843 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 38.5929 pixels translation and 0.0989752 radians rotation
