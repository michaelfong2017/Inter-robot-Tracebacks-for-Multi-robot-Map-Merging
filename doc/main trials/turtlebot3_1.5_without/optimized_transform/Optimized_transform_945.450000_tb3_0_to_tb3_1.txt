Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-104.342, 12.5446, 0.148464)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-104.342, 12.5446, 0.148464)

Error of original is 36.4289 pixels translation and 0.148464 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 36.4289 pixels translation and 0.148464 radians rotation
