Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-135.104, 20.2651, 0.0616641)

Error of adjusted is 4.90332 pixels translation and 0.0616641 radians rotation
