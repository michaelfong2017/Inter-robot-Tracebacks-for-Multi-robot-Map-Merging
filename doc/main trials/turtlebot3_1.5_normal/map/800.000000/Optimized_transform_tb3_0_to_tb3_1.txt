Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-133.013, 12.6126, 0.0703903)

Error of adjusted is 10.1684 pixels translation and 0.0703903 radians rotation
