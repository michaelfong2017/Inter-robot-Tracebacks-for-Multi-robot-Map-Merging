Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-135.685, 30.5802, 0.0861396)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-135.685, 30.5707, 0.08611)

Error of original is 11.4262 pixels translation and 0.0861396 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 11.4176 pixels translation and 0.08611 radians rotation
