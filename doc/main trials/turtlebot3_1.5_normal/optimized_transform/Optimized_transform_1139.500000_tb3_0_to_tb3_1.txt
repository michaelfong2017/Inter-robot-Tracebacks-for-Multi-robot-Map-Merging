Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-135.874, 29.7361, 0.0849941)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-135.876, 29.7314, 0.0849815)

Error of original is 10.5742 pixels translation and 0.0849941 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 10.5693 pixels translation and 0.0849815 radians rotation
