Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-130.69, 3.90294, 0.0346054)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-132.744, 11.2868, 0.0525197)

Error of original is 18.5955 pixels translation and 0.0346054 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 11.3389 pixels translation and 0.0525197 radians rotation
