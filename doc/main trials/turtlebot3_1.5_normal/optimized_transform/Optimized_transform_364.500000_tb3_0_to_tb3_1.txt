Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-116.552, 49.4488, 0.155663)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-119.489, 52.2887, 0.155664)

Error of original is 37.6434 pixels translation and 0.155663 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 38.2525 pixels translation and 0.155664 radians rotation
