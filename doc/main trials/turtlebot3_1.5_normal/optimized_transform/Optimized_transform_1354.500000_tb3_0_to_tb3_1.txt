Evaluation:
Expected transformed (x, y, r) of the global origin object
   from robot tb3_0's frame to robot tb3_1's frame:
Expected (x, y, r) = (-140, 20, 0)
Original estimated (x, y, r) = (-136.296, 28.8035, 0.0794541)
Adjusted estimated (x, y, r) = (-136.274, 27.1436, 0.0752441)

Error of original is 9.55092 pixels translation and 0.0794541 radians rotation
Error of adjusted is 8.05679 pixels translation and 0.0752441 radians rotation
